## 🏛️ Game Description

**Nostos** is an epic action RPG inspired by ancient Greek mythology, specifically the lost epic cycle "The Nostoi" (The Returns). Set in the aftermath of the legendary Trojan War, players embark on perilous journeys across the wine-dark Aegean Sea, each seeking their own *nostos* - their homecoming.

Built on the robust Diablo 2 engine architecture using Go and Ebiten, Nostos combines classical mythology with modern ARPG mechanics to create a unique gaming experience where every choice shapes your destiny and every path leads to a different kind of homecoming.

## 🎯 Game Philosophy

### The Meaning of Homecoming
Nostos is more than just "going home" - it's about what you've become during the journey and what "home" means when everything has changed. Each character's path explores different aspects of identity, responsibility, and the price of heroism.

### Choice & Consequence
Every decision matters. The game explores how small choices compound into life-altering consequences, how pride leads to downfall, and how wisdom can guide you safely through divine storms.

### Living Mythology  
The world of Nostos treats Greek mythology not as distant fairy tales but as living, breathing reality. Gods have personalities, motivations, and grudges. Heroes are flawed individuals struggling with impossible choices.

## 📚 Lore & Background

The game draws from "The Nostoi," a lost epic of ancient Greece that chronicled the varied fates of heroes returning from Troy. While Odysseus's journey became famous through Homer's *Odyssey*, the stories of other heroes were equally compelling - and often more tragic.

Nostos resurrects these forgotten tales, giving players the chance to experience the full scope of post-Trojan War mythology, from Nestor's blessed return to Agamemnon's bloody homecoming.
