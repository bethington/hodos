# The Nostoi: The Homecomings
## Game Story Foundation Document

### Overview

**The Nostoi** (Greek: Νόστοι, "The Returns") forms the narrative foundation for the Nostos game. This epic tale chronicles the diverse fates of the Greek heroes returning from the ten-year siege of Troy, each following their own path of *nostos* (homecoming) - some triumphant, others tragic, and one famously unfinished.

## Prologue: The Departure

### The Divine Conspiracy

The fires of Troy smoldered low. Amid the ruins, the Achaeans loaded their ships with treasure, captives, and memories too heavy to name. On the beach, sacrifices smoked, but the gods were divided.

Athena, her eyes flashing, whispered to Poseidon:
> *"Will you allow Ajax to return unscathed? He defiled my temple, dragged Cassandra from the holy ground. His nostos must be bitter."*

Poseidon gripped his trident. 
> *"So be it. Their sails will not reach home without a price."*

### The Scattering

The fleet set out, black ships spreading across the Aegean. At first the sea lay calm, but by nightfall, thunder rolled. The storm broke, scattering them like leaves before the wind. Each hero's fate branched into its own dark road.

## Chapter I: Nestor - The Safe Return
### *The Path of Wisdom*

**Character:** Nestor of Pylos  
**Archetype:** The Wise Elder  
**Journey Type:** Divine Protection  

In the heart of the storm, Nestor's ship pitched and rolled. His sons clung to the mast, terror in their eyes.

> *"Father!"* cried Thrasymedes. *"The sea will swallow us!"*

But Nestor stood firm, one hand on the tiller. His voice cut through the wind.
> *"Row steady, my sons! Fear no wave — we survived Troy's spears, and Poseidon himself knows the strength of Pylian arms."*

### The Homecoming
By dawn the sea calmed. Land rose on the horizon, green and welcome. Pylos — his home. His people rushed to the shore, their voices like music after ten years of war.

Nestor embraced his queen, Eurydice, and kissed the earth. His *nostos* was the gentlest of all, the gods sparing him for his wisdom and age.

**Game Significance:** Represents the ideal homecoming - wisdom and piety rewarded.

## Chapter II: Diomedes - The Triumphant Return
### *The Path of Valor*

**Character:** Diomedes of Argos  
**Archetype:** The Fearless Warrior  
**Journey Type:** Triumph Through Courage  

Elsewhere, Diomedes of Argos battled the sea as fiercely as he had battled gods. His helmsman cried out:
> *"Lord, the waves rise higher than the walls of Troy!"*

Diomedes laughed, salt spray on his face.
> *"Then we shall storm them too! Hold fast — Argos awaits us!"*

### The Victory
The storm relented before his defiance. His ships reached Argive shores battered but unbroken. The people poured forth, garlanding their hero, who had dared to wound Ares and Aphrodite on the field of Troy.

No dark ambush awaited him. Diomedes took up his throne again, though later strife with his kin and neighbors would mar his reign. For now, his *nostos* was sweet, his name sung in Argive halls.

**Game Significance:** Courage and directness can overcome divine obstacles.

## Chapter III: Menelaus - The Long Wandering
### *The Path of Atonement*

**Character:** Menelaus of Sparta  
**Archetype:** The Burdened King  
**Journey Type:** Wandering and Redemption  

Menelaus' fleet did not share such fortune. Driven south, they broke upon the coast of Crete, then Cyprus, then further still until Egypt's strange shores rose beneath the desert sun.

There, Menelaus gazed across the Nile.
> *"Is this Sparta? No… the gods mock me. We are farther from home than when we left Troy."*

Helen stood beside him, her beauty undimmed.
> *"Patience, my husband. The sea plays cruel games, but the gods will not deny us forever."*

### The Trial of Proteus
Yet years passed, filled with exile and delay. At last Menelaus seized Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, who writhed into beasts and flames before yielding.

> *"Your way lies westward,"* Proteus told him. *"Make sacrifice, and the sea will grant your return."*

So, after long wandering, Menelaus returned to Sparta. But his *nostos* was not swift — it was the wandering of a man whose prize, Helen, had cost the world a war.

**Game Significance:** Some sins require long atonement; knowledge must be earned through trial.

## Chapter IV: Agamemnon - The Doomed Return
### *The Path of Hubris*

**Character:** Agamemnon of Mycenae  
**Archetype:** The Tragic King  
**Journey Type:** Swift Return to Doom  

The high king's ships reached Mycenae unbroken, and Agamemnon's heart swelled with pride.

> *"At last,"* he told his men, *"the throne of Mycenae, the embrace of Clytemnestra. The gods have granted me victory and return alike."*

### The Conspiracy
But in the palace, Clytemnestra whispered with Aegisthus.

> *"He comes,"* she said. *"The butcher of our daughter. The murderer of Iphigenia."*  
> Aegisthus laid a hand on his sword. *"Then let him come. We shall greet him in blood."*

### The Fatal Pride
When Agamemnon arrived, she met him with smiles and false warmth.

> *"My lord, my king! Walk upon these purple tapestries — a conqueror deserves no less."*

He hesitated. 
> *"Such honor belongs to the gods, not to mortal men."*

But her eyes gleamed. 
> *"For you, my husband, the gods themselves yield."*

He stepped across the tapestries into the halls. Later, in the bath, she cast a net upon him. Aegisthus struck. The king's cry was choked in steam and blood. His *nostos* ended in betrayal.

**Game Significance:** Pride leads to downfall; past sins return to claim their price.

## Chapter V: Neoptolemus - The March Overland
### *The Path of Conquest*

**Character:** Neoptolemus, son of Achilles  
**Archetype:** The Young Conqueror  
**Journey Type:** Rejection of Sea, Conquest by Land  

While others braved the waves, Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, spat into the sea.

> *"Why trust Poseidon? My father's spear was made for the earth. We march!"*

### The New Kingdom
Through Thrace and Epirus he led his men, carving out a kingdom by swordpoint. He stood upon rocky heights and proclaimed:
> *"Here we build anew — not as beggars to the sea, but as lords of the land."*

His *nostos* was no return but a conquest, a new beginning forged in blood. Fate would one day claim him at Delphi, but for a time, he strode the earth like a shadow of Achilles reborn.

**Game Significance:** Sometimes the journey changes the destination; new paths can be forged.

## Chapter VI: Orestes - The Shadow of Vengeance
### *The Path Unfulfilled*

**Character:** Orestes, son of Agamemnon  
**Archetype:** The Avenger  
**Journey Type:** The Return Yet to Come  

In distant Phocis, young Orestes grew in exile. Messengers whispered of his father's murder, his mother's shame, his usurped throne.

One night he swore before the altar of Apollo:
> *"I will return. Blood calls for blood. My father shall be avenged. My nostos will be vengeance."*

The seeds of tragedy took root, though the Nostoi left his fate unfinished. Later poets would tell how he came home in shadow, with a sword in hand and the Furies at his heels.

**Game Significance:** Some journeys span generations; vengeance is its own form of return.

---

## Chapter VII: The Absent One
### *The Greatest Tale Untold*

And yet, through all these returns, one hero was missing. Odysseus, the man of many wiles, still wandered the wine-dark sea. His ships shattered, his men devoured, his heart aching for Ithaca.

The Nostoi ended here, leaving his fate untold. Another song, another bard, would take up his tale — the greatest *nostos* of all.

**Game Significance:** The ultimate journey - cunning, endurance, and the longest road home.

## Narrative Structure

The Nostoi provides a **branching narrative structure** where:
- Each hero's journey can be experienced independently
- Choices in one story may affect others
- Multiple endings reflect different types of homecoming
- The player's path determines which kind of *nostos* they achieve

The story serves as both historical foundation and living mythology, allowing players to explore what it truly means to come home after everything has changed.

*"The wine-dark sea remembers all who cross it, but only the worthy find their way home."*
